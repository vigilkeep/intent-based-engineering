# Intent-Based Engineering Framework - Community Discussions

Welcome to the Intent-Based Engineering framework community! This repository hosts discussions for the framework while documentation lives on GitLab.

## 📚 Framework Documentation

**Primary Documentation**: [gitlab.com/vigilkeep/intent-based-engineering](https://gitlab.com/vigilkeep/intent-based-engineering)

The Intent-Based Engineering framework provides systematic approaches for:
- Preserving decision context and rationale (preventing "archaeological software")
- Separating capabilities from constraints in architecture
- Creating self-describing software systems
- Building knowledge that survives team changes

This is **research-in-progress seeking validation** through real-world implementation experiences.

## 🔄 Two-Platform Approach

### Why Two Platforms?

We use GitHub and GitLab together because each excels at different things:

**GitHub** (Here):
- ✅ Rich discussion features with categories
- ✅ Q&A format with accepted answers
- ✅ Easy threading and exploration
- ✅ Good for open-ended conversations
- ✅ Natural community building

**GitLab** ([Primary Repository](https://gitlab.com/vigilkeep/intent-based-engineering)):
- ✅ Framework documentation source of truth
- ✅ Templates and implementation guides
- ✅ Part 8 Living Documentation (Wiki)
- ✅ Formal contributions via merge requests
- ✅ Version control for documentation

### Contribution Flow

```
Discuss Here (GitHub)
    ↓
Explore & Get Feedback
    ↓
Formalize There (GitLab)
    ↓
Submit Documentation
    ↓
Recognition Both Places
```

**Start Here**: Questions, experiences, ideas, patterns  
**Formalize There**: Documentation, templates, formal contributions

## 🎯 What Makes This Framework Different

### Research-in-Progress

This framework represents **testable hypotheses** requiring validation through diverse real-world application. We're not claiming proven methodology—we're seeking evidence to validate or invalidate our approaches.

### Negative Results Welcome

**Your failures are as valuable as your successes.** If you tried the framework and it didn't work, that information is critical for framework evolution. Intellectual honesty strengthens understanding.

### Evidence-Based Evolution

Framework evolves based on implementation evidence, not theoretical arguments. Your real-world experiences—with sufficient context—are how we learn what actually works.

### Questions Strengthen Framework

Confusion signals documentation improvement opportunities. Critique reveals blind spots. Alternative approaches expand solution space. **Questions are contributions, not interruptions.**

---

## 📖 How to Contribute

### 1. Share Your Experience (Start Here)

**Easiest Contribution**: Tell us about your framework application attempts in [Implementation Experiences](https://github.com/vigilkeep/intent-based-engineering/discussions/categories/implementation-experiences).

**What We Want to Know**:
- What you tried and why
- What worked and what didn't
- What surprised you
- What you'd do differently

**Honesty > Polish**: Partial information and in-progress experiences are valuable.

### 2. Document Your Implementation

**Most Valuable Contribution**: Use templates from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/vigilkeep/intent-based-engineering/-/tree/main/templates) to formally document your experience.

**Process**:
1. Discuss approach here first (optional but helpful)
2. Apply framework to your project
3. Document using GitLab template
4. Submit via merge request or Wiki edit
5. Recognition on both platforms

### 3. Propose Patterns

**Reusable Knowledge**: Extract patterns from your experience and share for community validation.

**Start Here**: [Patterns and Anti-Patterns](https://github.com/vigilkeep/intent-based-engineering/discussions/categories/patterns-and-anti-patterns)

**Confidence Progression**:
- ⚡ Hypothesis → 🌱 Early Evidence → ✅ Validated → 🏆 Proven

### 4. Ask Questions

Questions help everyone. Ask in [General Q&A](https://github.com/vigilkeep/intent-based-engineering/discussions/categories/general-q-a).

**Good Questions Include**:
- Your context (team size, domain, experience)
- What you've already tried or read
- Specific confusion or challenge
- Concrete example if applicable

### 5. Help Others

Community support is valuable contribution. Share your experience and perspective when you can help others.

## 📋 Discussion Quality Standards

### What Makes Good Discussions

**✅ Specific Context**: Describe your environment, constraints, team  
**✅ Real Examples**: Concrete situations, not vague observations  
**✅ Evidence-Based**: Data, measurements, or multiple implementations  
**✅ Honest Assessment**: Acknowledge both successes and failures  
**✅ Open Exploration**: Invite input rather than seeking validation

### Discussion Norms

**Intellectual Honesty**: Frame hypotheses as hypotheses, acknowledge uncertainty

**Evidence-Based**: Label speculation clearly, prefer measurements when available

**Respectful Skepticism**: Critique ideas not people, welcome alternatives

**Learning-Oriented**: Questions are opportunities, mistakes are lessons

**Collaborative**: Framework improves through community input
